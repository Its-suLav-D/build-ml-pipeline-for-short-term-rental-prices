# ML Pipeline for Short-Term Rental Prices in NYC

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end ML pipeline for estimating short-term rental prices in New York City. The pipeline includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training (Random Forest), and model evaluation steps.

## Pipeline Steps
1. **Data Download**: Fetch the latest dataset sample.
2. **Basic Cleaning**: Perform initial data cleaning and preprocessing.
3. **Data Validation**: Run tests to ensure data quality and consistency.
4. **Data Splitting**: Separate data into train, validation, and test sets.
5. **Train Random Forest**: Train and optimize a Random Forest model.
6. **Model Performance Evaluation**: Assess model performance on test data.

## Technologies Used
- MLflow
- Hydra
- Weights & Biases (W&B)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
